# First Pass: The Silent Game Jam

Welcome to the First Pass Game Jam, a unique challenge designed to push the boundaries of collaborative game development under a set of intriguing constraints. This game jam invites participants to contribute to a collective game project in shifts, with a twist on the traditional collaborative process.

## Overview

In this game jam, developers work in 1-2 hour shifts to add their contributions to a tiny scope game. The catch? There's absolutely no communication allowed between participants. Each developer must intuitively build upon the previous contributions without any form of direct discussion, notes, or explicit guidance.

## Technical Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to the game project technically. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

### 1. Setup Your Environment

- **Download Unity**: Ensure you have Unity version 2021.3.29f1 installed.
- **Clone the Repository**: Clone the game jam's main branch repository to your local machine.

### 2. Begin Your Development Shift

- **Create Your Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution, naming it using the format `<your slot #>/<yourname>`. For example, `00/zak`.
- **Work Locally**: Make your changes locally.

### 3. Commit Your Changes

- **Commit Often**: Make commits as you work to document your progress. Use clear, descriptive commit messages to outline what has been added or changed.
- **Final Commit**: Once your development shift is complete, make a final commit summarizing your contributions.

### 4. Open a Pull Request (PR)

- **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to the repository.
- **Create a PR**: Open a Pull Request against the main branch. Ensure your PR title clearly, like `Finished: <Your Name>`.

### 5. Build and Share

- **Make a Build**: Create a build of the game incorporating your contributions.
- **Share Your Work**: Direct message Zak with a link to your PR and an accessible link to your game build. If possible, include a brief video or screenshots demonstrating what has been added or modified.

## Base Rules

- **No Direct Communication**: Participants must not leave messages, comments, or instructions for other developers. The development process should be entirely based on interpretation and intuition.

- **Build Iteratively**: Aim to add to the project constructively, focusing on enhancement without negating or removing previous contributions.

- **Keep It Appropriate**: All content introduced into the game must be suitable for a general audience, adhering to community guidelines and ensuring inclusivity.

## Schedule

The game jam starts on 3/25/2024 and ends on 3/29/24.

## Tools and Resources

Participants are required to use Unity 2021.3.29f1 for this project. This ensures that all contributions are compatible and can be integrated smoothly.
